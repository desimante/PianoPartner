            <p>What's the purpose? Classical karaoke</p>
            <p>When you are a solo player, it's kind of difficult to imagine playing as part of a whole when you require an accompanist during your perforamnces</p>
            <p>The offer here(recording) is not to replace true accompanists as they wil follow you as you perform and support you as you creatively perform as a soloist - the perpose of these recording is to give an overal sense of practicing with the whole.</p>
